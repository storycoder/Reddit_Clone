== README

I followed along with Macenzie Child's on his - [Clone Reddit with Rails Video](https://mackenziechild.me/12-in-12/1/)

I made some small changes along the way. 

Following along with Mackenzie reinfornced things I'm learning about calling on route paths inside of my app (ie .. links_path takes you to links/index.html.erb new_link_path takes you to new.html.erb, etc... I'd have to look the others up, but I know how to find a path via ```rake routes``` )
